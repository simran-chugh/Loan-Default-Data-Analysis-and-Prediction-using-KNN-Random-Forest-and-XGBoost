# 💳 Loan Default Prediction — ML Project
🔹 Project Overview

Analyzed loan data to predict borrower defaults using KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science skills: data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

It’s designed to show practical ML application in financial risk assessment — exactly the kind of work recruiters in data science/fintech look for.

🚀 Key Highlights

Preprocessed and cleaned real-world loan data

Engineered features to improve predictive accuracy

Built and compared three machine learning models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluated models using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices

Identified best-performing model for default prediction

🧠 Key Insights

Certain borrower features strongly influence default risk

XGBoost achieved highest accuracy and ROC-AUC, outperforming KNN and Random Forest

Data-driven insights can help lenders reduce risk and improve credit decisions

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python, Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
